ðŸ’» Secure Exam Proctoring Server (Backend)This repository contains the backend server for an AI-powered online examination monitoring system. It is a real-time WebSocket server built with Python that handles camera input, processes video frames using the YOLOv8 model for proctoring analysis, and streams the results (video feed and metrics) to a connected frontend client.âœ¨ FeaturesThe working_server.py script provides the core real-time monitoring functionality:Real-time Video Processing: Captures frames from a connected webcam and encodes them for transmission to the client.AI-Powered Detection (YOLOv8): Integrates the YOLOv8n model to perform object detection on video frames.Detects Person presence.Detects unauthorized Cell Phones (class 67) and Laptops (class 63).Proctoring Metrics & Alerts: Generates real-time metrics, including object detection counts and simulated Head Pose and Eye Gaze deviation. Triggers alerts for unauthorized devices or if no person is detected.Automatic Camera Detection: Attempts to initialize and confirm the stability of the local camera (checking indices 0-4).Simulated Fallback Mode: If no working camera is found, the server automatically switches to generating simulated video frames and metrics to allow testing of the frontend interface.WebSocket Interface: Runs a secure, persistent connection on ws://localhost:8765 for low-latency, real-time data streaming.ðŸ›  Prerequisites and DependenciesTo run this server, you need Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:DependencyInstallation Commandwebsocketspip install websocketsopencv-python (cv2)pip install opencv-pythonultralyticspip install ultralyticstorchpip install torchnumpypip install numpyðŸš€ UsageInstall dependencies: pip install websockets opencv-python ultralytics torch numpyRun the server: python working_server.pyThe server will display its status, including the camera status and YOLO model integration. It will listen for connections at ws://localhost:8765.Secure Exam Proctoring System FrontendThis repository contains the front-end user interface for an AI-powered online examination monitoring system. It provides a comprehensive, modern, and secure environment for students to take proctored online exams, featuring a login page, a camera and environment setup wizard, and a real-time monitoring dashboard.âœ¨ FeaturesThe application is structured into three main views:Login Page: Secure sign-in form with a connection test for the backend WebSocket server and a list of exam requirements (stable internet, webcam, microphone).Setup Wizard: A multi-step process to verify the student's environment and identity before the exam begins, including Camera Access and Environment Check.Proctoring Dashboard: The main exam interface with real-time monitoring:Live Proctoring Feed.Real-time Metrics on student behavior, including Head Pose and Eye Gaze deviation.Security Status and an Activity Log for suspicious events.ðŸ›  Technologies UsedThis front-end is built using standard web technologies:HTML5Tailwind CSS: For rapid, utility-first styling (linked via CDN).Vanilla JavaScript: Implements core logic, state management, and handles the WebSocket connection for real-time data.WebSockets: Used to communicate with the backend proctoring server for live data transmission.ðŸš€ Getting StartedBackend Prerequisite: Ensure the Backend Server (from working_server.py) is running and listening on ws://localhost:8765.Open the file: Save the frontend code as an index.html file and open it directly in your web browser.ðŸ”‘ Demo CredentialsUse the following credentials on the login page to test the application's flow:RoleEmailPasswordStudent 1student1@university.edupassword123Demo Studentdemo@student.edudemo123# AI_Verse_proctor
